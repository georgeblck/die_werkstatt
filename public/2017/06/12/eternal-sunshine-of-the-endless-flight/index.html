<p>I am sitting on a plane from Rome to Philadelphia, marveling at how quickly we can move around the globe. There is a 6 hour time-zone difference between Rome and Philadelphia. My flight took off at 11am in Rome and was set to arrive 9 hours and 45 minutes later at 3:45pm in Philadelphia. This got me thinking, what would your daily schedule look like if you continuously flew west?</p>
<p>My calculations are based on gross approximations from the information given in the seatback display in front of me. For example, I am assuming that you could fly continuously forever, and I am assuming that the rate at which my flight is changing time-zones would be representative. We will also not take seasonal changes into account and assume a 12 hour day/night cycle.</p>
<div id="stupid-simple-calculations" class="section level1">
<h1>Stupid simple calculations</h1>
<p>First, I am going to calculate the effective rate at which time is progressing for me in the air (relative to the day/night cycles for someone fixed on the ground).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>effective.rate &lt;- (15.75-11.00)/9.75
(effective.rate*60)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 29.23077</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every hour that passes on the ground (with respect to day/night cycles), I experience only 29.23 minutes of progression in the day/night cycle.</p>
<p>Since there are no appreciable relativistic effects occuring at 858 kilometers/hour (our speed according to the display), we can say that I experience the passage of 1 hour identically to the experience of someone remaining in the same location on the ground. In that way, I do not feel that 1 hour feels longer or shorter while in flight. Now I will calculate the number of hours it would take to experience a full day/night cycle when traveling at this rate.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(24/effective.rate)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 49.26316</code></pre>
<p>Therefore the passage of one full day/night cycle would take about 49.26 hours or that day/night would each last about <span class="math inline">\(24.63\)</span> hours.</p>
<p>Thats a pretty long day.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-little-farther" class="section level1">
<h1>A little farther</h1>
<p>I have long said that my internal clock is acctually a 26 hour schedule. Effectively, if left to my own devices, I tend to go to bed about 2 hours later every night and wake up 2 hours later every morning (doing a full cycle every 12 days). So what speed must I be traveling west at to achieve this desired 26 hour day?</p>
<p>I will start by calculating the time it takes to cross 1 time-zone and the resulting estimate for the average number of kilometers per time-zone during my trip.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>current.speed &lt;- 858 # kilometers per hour
(km.per.tz &lt;- (9.75/6)*current.speed) #(hours in flight/time zone difference)*current speed</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1394.25</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>desired.cycle.length &lt;- 26
(1-24/desired.cycle.length)*km.per.tz</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 107.25</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, if I traveled west at about 107.25 km/h my day would appear to be 26 hours long.</p>
<p>These calculations are not completely correct but I am guessing I am within about 25% of the correct result based on <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/187730/how-fast-would-one-have-to-travel-in-an-airplane-in-order-to-experience-a-contin">this physics stackexchange post</a>. Under certain conditions they calculate that at the equator traveling at 1672.2 km/h would allow you to track the sunset. I find that you would have to travel at 1394.25 which is 0.83% of their answer.</p>
<p>My approximation would likely be much better if I considered that my flight was not at the equator and that my speed and direction (velocity) was not constant throughout the entirety of the flight.</p>
<p>Either way I find this an interesting thought experiment.</p>
