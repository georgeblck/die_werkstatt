      <description>For users of PhILR (Paper, R Package), and also for users of the ILR transform that wan to make use of the awesome plotting functions in R. I wanted to share a function for plotting a sequential binary partition on a tree using the ggtree package. I recently wrote this for a manuscript but figured it might be of more general use to others as well.
In its simplest form a sequential binary partition can be represented as a binary tree.</description>
