## About this visualization

In September 2015 the European Commission proposed a plan to relocate 120'000 refugees from Greece, Italy & Hungary to all European countries.
This was supposed to be done by a *mandatory distribution key using objective and quantifiable criteria*, consisting of the following variables and weightings:
> * the size of the population (40%, positive weight),
> * the GDP (40%, positive weight),
> * the average number of past asylum applications (10%, negative weight) and
> * the unemployment rate (10%, negative weight).
